##Introduction

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the subreddit of the poet laureate of rock 'n' roll.

The voice of the promise of the '60s counter-culture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock. Who donned make-up in the '70s and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse. Who emerged to find Jesus. Who was written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s and who suddenly shifted gears, releasing some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the late '90s. 

Ladies and gentlemen â€” Columbia recording artist **Bob Dylan**!
